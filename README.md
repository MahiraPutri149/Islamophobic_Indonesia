Islamophobia is a negative attitude and behavior that refers to prejudice, discrimination, fear, and hatred of Islam and Muslims. Certainly, it is not easy to detect Islamophobia, especially at this point when everyone can create content or access information on social media like Twitter and websites. It is clear that online platforms like Twitter and websites have a policy to stop users who promote Islamophobia, but content like that still exists, creating a problem for the Muslim community. Furthermore, in previous studies, Islamophobia constitutes a major racist discourse at this time. Therefore, it becomes pivotal to find solutions to eradicate such speech from social media platforms. This paper presents an effective methodology for detecting Islamophobia in social media, specifically Twitter and websites using the Support Vector Machine. Using this technique, based on a dataset consisting of 1582 preprocessed online tweets, accuracy of up to 87% was obtained.
